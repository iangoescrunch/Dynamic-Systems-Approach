            <p>Reading Chapter 3 messed with how I think about perception and action. I come from a computer science background, so I default to programs, algorithms, information processing. Perception as input, cognition as computation, action as output. Thelen and Smith want me to throw out that whole framework. It's liberating but also kind of anxiety-inducing.</p>

            <p>The horse gait example is what got to me. When a horse speeds up, it doesn't switch from walk to trot to gallop because some neural program kicks in at preset speed thresholds. The gait just emerges. The system self-organizes into whatever pattern is most energetically efficient given the horse's anatomy and current speed. No instruction manual. No gait-selection algorithm. Just biomechanics doing what biomechanics does under changing constraints.</p>

            <p>This seems huge for thinking about perception. When I see a chair as "sit-on-able," am I running some computation that extracts features and matches them to stored knowledge? Or is this an emergent property? My body-environment system settling into a stable configuration around action possibilities? The dynamic systems view pushes toward the latter. Affordances aren't features I compute over. They're attractor states that pop out when my body's capabilities couple with environmental structure in the right way. A chair affords sitting not because I calculated seat height, but because the perception-action system finds stable coordination there.</p>

            <p>What gets me is that we're not just information processors. We're energy-cycling organisms in constant metabolic exchange with the world. This can't be irrelevant to perception. When I scan a room, my eye movements aren't just sampling information. They're consuming energy, structuring what becomes perceptible. The perceiver and perceived are thermodynamically linked, not just informationally related.</p>

            <p>The order parameter concept compresses degrees of freedom, which seems useful for perception. Take binocular rivalry. Two incompatible images competing, switching back and forth. Instead of some homunculus deciding what to see, maybe it's competing attractors in neural state space. The slave relation means countless neurons self-organize into collective states where one image dominates, then fluctuations push the system toward the alternative. No executive needed.</p>

            <p>Kelso's finger studies give me something I can actually work with methodologically. Enhanced fluctuations and critical slowing before phase transitions. That's testable. Could we see the same thing when perceptual organization is about to flip? With bistable figures like the Necker cube? If perception runs on dynamic principles, percept durations should get more variable and recovery from perturbations should slow near transition points. That seems doable in ways that vague talk about "perceptual processing" never is.</p>

            <p>The time scale stuff makes my head hurt. Perceptual systems have local relaxation times (how fast you re-stabilize after a visual glitch), global equilibration times (long-term perceptual adaptation), and control parameter change rates (like prism adaptation versus sudden lighting changes). Development must nest these timescales. Real-time perception inside developmental time inside evolutionary time.</p>

            <p>But I'm stuck on control parameters in perception. Kelso used cycling frequency. Obvious and manipulable. What are the control parameters for perceptual shifts? Stimulus intensity? Attention? The chapter says control parameters are nonspecific to the pattern they produce. That clashes with everything I learned about specific stimulus features activating specific detectors. Maybe that's the computational baggage I need to drop.</p>

            <p>The noise section connects to Gibson in a way I didn't expect. Gibson said perceptual information lives in the variance, not the mean. In optic flow patterns from movement, in acoustic transformations. Dynamic systems theory explains why: fluctuations aren't signal corruption, they're how systems explore state space and find stability. When you walk on uneven ground, gait variability isn't error. It's adaptation, finding stability under shifting constraints.</p>

            <p>My real question: what happens to mental representation if I take this seriously? In computer science, representations are fundamental. Data structures underlying computation. But self-organizing systems don't represent their patterns. A horse doesn't represent its gallop before executing it. The pattern emerges from dynamics. Does perception work the same way? No representations, just emergence? Or can representations exist as temporary attractors that stabilize information?</p>

            <p>This matters for how I run experiments. If perception self-organizes in real-time instead of computing over stored representations, I need to manipulate energy flow, timescale relations, system coupling. Not just stimulus features and response times. The horse gait shifts by changing speed, a scalar control parameter. What's the equivalent for perception-action systems? That's what I need to figure out.</p>
